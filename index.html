    <h1>Evil Text Editor Kata</h1>
    <p>You've been asked to build a text editor, but the client can only afford
      to pay for six features.  They can't make up their mind though, so they
      won't tell you what each feature is until you've completed the previous
      one.</p>
    <p>All you know at the beginning of the project is that the editor will have
      a buffer and a cursor, don't even worry about a graphical component.
      Click the button below once you're ready for your first feature.</p>
    <div id="features"><ol></ol></div>
    <button onclick="display_next_feature(this)">Give me a feature</button>
