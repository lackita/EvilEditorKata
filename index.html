    <h1>Evil Text Editor Kata</h1>
    <p>You've been asked to build a single line text editor, but the
      client can only afford to pay for six features.  They can't make
      up their mind though, so they won't tell you what each feature
      is until you've completed the previous one.  The purpose of this
      kata is to embrace change, so keep your design simple
      enough that it can respond to this change easily.</p>
    <p>All you know at the beginning of the project is that the editor
      will have a buffer and a cursor, don't worry about a graphical
      component.  You can assume that the buffer has some starting
      text.  Click the button below once you're ready for your first
      feature.</p>
    <div id="features"><ol></ol></div>
    <button onclick="display_next_feature(this)">Give me a feature</button>
  </body>
