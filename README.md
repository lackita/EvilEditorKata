Evil Text Editor Kata
=====================
You're building a text editor, but your stakeholder can't make a decision about what feature to build next.  As a result, you are only told about what feature to build next once you finish the current one.

Head over [here](http://blog.colinwilliams.name/EvilEditorKata) to get your first feature.
